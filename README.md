Yet Another Learning Tool

Karan Goel, 2013

Yet Another Learning Tool (YALT) is a lightweight
utility to make it easier for you to remember things.
It is a flash-card like system, where you'lll be
presented with random questions from selected database.
With YALT, you have to spend less time learning more.

Currently, YALT supports only single line questions
and answers in plain text.

I've tried to make YALT as simple and minimalistic as possible. 
But if you have any other suggestions, please contact me: karan@goel.im

Download
===

Download the jar file here: http://www.goel.im/vault/YALT.zip

Unzip, and click on YALT.jar.

Make sure you never move, delete or rename any other files or folders.

Usage
===

To get started, YALT is packaged with three databases with a few questions
each. These will help you get a feel of the app.

You can add a new database or edit existing databases. Add, edit or delete 
rows in databases. To edit rows, simply double-click on any cell, and 
edit away. Changes are saved automatically.

Future
===

I want to add a feature so YALT can interact with the Wolfram Alpha, or 
Yahoo Answers or any other knowledge databases to get answers for 
your questions immediately. If that seems like a valid idea to you, 
please shoot me an email, and I'll try to push the feature as soon as I can.

Also, in store will be cloud backup of databases (DropBox and GDrive for now). 
Again, shoot me an email if you'd like to this feature ASAP.

Feedback
===

YALT is my first complete program built 100% by me. I consider YALT as a 
first step me the miles long journey ahead of me. Your feedback will keep 
my motivated, and help me program better.

Please let me know what you think of YALT, or if you have any suggestions. 
Or, just say Hi - I'm very frindly, and rarely bite. :)
